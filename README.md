# hello-world

That is the branch for testing of hello-world repo 

This line from branch2 
was written 
and corrected by me to take more tests on
developing capabilities of git for functionjs project

And I had added new line of text

$y=x^2$

----------------

|x    | 0   |  1  | 2   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|y    | 0   | 1   | 4   | 

-------------------------

```c++ start=1 
for(int x=0; x<10; x++){
    cout << x;
}
```

~~~~ruby startline=2 
def foo(x)
  return 3
end
